          <p>I currently work for a small production company that does both commercial work
            for other clients and our own stuff. One of the more amazing things about what I do 
            is I can learn on the job, and learning about green screen has been amazing.
            I am still working on the final product, but here are a few stills from of our work
            which is a kind of unique art in its own way.

        <p>Another amazing opportunity I have is the the ability to travel with my 
          co-workers when we are sent to film on certain gigs. The client we current 
          work for is a non-profit that gives back to injured veterans and first responders 
          who need a home. My job is to go out and record these amazing ceremonies no matter 
          the state. All expenses paid for! Then come back to the office to edit together 
          an emotional video for the client and their sponsors. Here is a shot  took at one 
          of the events that I can share.

            <p>I don't think what I do is amazing or anything, but I do like what I do and what I 
              can create from it. I am currently a Film Major at UCF and I knew  wanted to get into 
              editing early on. I am so blessed that along the way I picked up some audio skills which 
              allowed me to get exposure to people that put in a good word for me. It's kind of true 
              what they say about it being mostly who you know, and having a great attitude on set 
              or any surrounding.
